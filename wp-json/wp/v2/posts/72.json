The four-round tournament record is 22 under, set by Kenny Perry in 2009.Bradley missed a 20-foot putt on 18 that would have tied the PGA Tour\u2019s 54-hole mark of 188 set by Steve Stricker in the 2010 John Deere Classic and matched by Justin Thomas in the 2017 Sony Open. Bradley opened with rounds of 62 and 63.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ve wanted to win this tournament forever,\u201d said Bradley, a Vermont native who also lived in Massachusetts and was playing in front of a large contingent of family and friends. \u201cSo, the feeling of wanting to push and win is something I need to fight against<a href=\"https:\/\/myacca.b2b.accaglobal.com\/\"> and just let myself<\/a> go out and play.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Chez Reavie was a shot back after a 63. He led for much of the back nine, but made a bogey on the par-3 16th, while Bradley hit his tee shot to 6 feet and converted the birdie putt for a two-stroke swing. Bradley finished second to Reavie in the 2019 Travelers.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI had a big lead and then Keegan made a bunch of birdies throughout the beginning and middle part of the round to make it really close,\u201d Reavie said. \u201cTomorrow is going to be the opposite. It\u2019s going to be a shootout.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Fowler just missed the 13th sub-60 round in Tour history. After failing to convert from just off the green on his final hole, he wound up tied for fourth at 15 under in the event where Jim Furyk shot a Tour-record 58 in 2016.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI hit a decent chip, just hit it a little soft,\u201d Fowler said. \u201cA tap in for 60 is never a bad thing. It\u2019s better than a 61.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity\" data-embed-button=\"teaser_embed\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:node.teaser_article_embed\" data-entity-type=\"node\" data-entity-uuid=\"6c8a61c0-e15f-40d5-8b94-93d4453a9da1\" data-langcode=\"en\" data-entity-embed-display-settings=\"[]\">\n<div class=\"node node--type-article node--view-mode-teaser-article-embed teaser teaser--horizontal mb-6\" role=\"article\">\n<div class=\"row\">\n<div class=\"col lg:col-8\">\n<div class=\"photo\">\n<div class=\"photo\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"image-style-content-section-thumbnail\" src=\"https:\/\/www.golfchannel.com\/sites\/default\/files\/styles\/content_section_thumbnail\/public\/2023\/06\/24\/Fowler_1920_Travelers23_D3_Wedge.jpg?itok=ynXnwilx\" width=\"320\" height=\"180\" \/><\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"col lg:col-16\">\n<div class=\"flex justify-start\"><\/div>\n<div class=\"field field--name-field-tabloid-headline field--type-string field--label-hidden\">\n<h1 class=\"headline\">After 62 at the U.S. Open, Fowler flirts with 59<\/h1>\n<\/div>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Last week, Rickie Fowler shot the first 62 in U.S. Open history. This week, he flirted with his first 59 on the PGA Tour.<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<p>Fowler was a shot behind Patrick Cantlay, who had a bogey-free 61 that included five birdies on his final seven holes. Cantlay was the first player to shoot a 60 on this course, doing it as a 19-year-old amateur in 2011.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThe scoring on this golf course is usually on the back nine in that middle stretch,\u201d he said. \u201cI played the front nine 4 under. If you can get the front nine you can shoot a real low one, so tomorrow with the scores low I imagine it\u2019ll take another low one.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Denny McCarthy opened with a 60 on Thursday and shared the second-round lead with Bradley at a tournament-record 125.<\/p>\n<p>McCarthy fell back early Saturday, making three bogeys on the front nine for a 37. He shot 70, leaving him tied with Fowler and Adam Scott (65).<\/p>\n<p>An almost half inch of rain delayed the start to the round until 11 a.m., with players going off in threesomes on both front and back nine. But it also kept the greens soft and the scoring low.<\/p>\n<p>Fowler, who shot the first 62 in U.S. Open history last week, had seven birdies on his first 11 holes Saturday.<\/p>\n<p>He was at 7 under on the par-5 sixth hole when he hit a little chip shot from 60 feet that bounced onto the green and rolled straight into the hole for an eagle.<\/p>\n<p>Thomas also put himself in contention Saturday with a 62, leaving him in a group at 14 under.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ve felt very close for a while, just have had literally nothing to show for it,\u201d Thomas said. \u201cAnd you never know. I\u2019m one round away tomorrow from kind of completely changing my focus and outlook on the year and the rest of the year.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Top-ranked Scottie Scheffler shot a 63 and was also in that group.<\/p>\n<p>U.S. Open champion Wyndham Clark had a 67 to get to 8 under.<\/p>\n<\/article>\n<aside class=\"main-content__sidebar\">\n<div id=\"article_trending_content_block\">\n<div>\n<div class=\"sidebar\"><\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/aside>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>CROMWELL, Conn. \u2014 Keegan Bradley shot a 6-under 64 on Saturday to break the tournament 54-hole scoring record at 21 under in the Travelers Championship, while Rickie Fowler had the second 60 of the week at TPC River Highlands.The previous three-round mark was 18 under, set by Brendon Todd on an empty course during the<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"footnotes":""},"categories":[3],"tags":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/storybook.spectator.co.uk\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/72"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/storybook.spectator.co.uk\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/storybook.spectator.co.uk\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/storybook.spectator.co.uk\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/storybook.spectator.co.uk\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=72"}],"version-history":[{"count":3,"href":"https:\/\/storybook.spectator.co.uk\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/72\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":97,"href":"https:\/\/storybook.spectator.co.uk\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/72\/revisions\/97"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/storybook.spectator.co.uk\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=72"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/storybook.spectator.co.uk\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=72"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/storybook.spectator.co.uk\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=72"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
