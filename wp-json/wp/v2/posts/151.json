Rainfall is becoming more unpredictable. Extreme weather is on the rise.<\/p>\n<p>According to the\u00a0Centre for Research on the Epidemiology of Disasters (EM-DAT), the country recorded 38 episodes of floods or catastrophic landslides, 12 severe storms, 13 wildfires, and nine episodes of extreme heat between 1970 and 2019 &#8212; around two million people were affected, with damages estimated at US$4.785 million.<\/p>\n<p>Such extreme climate events have become\u00a030 times more frequent\u00a0over the past fifty years.<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s also getting hotter and drier. The last decade has been the warmest in the last 100 years. Rainfall has been scarce in recent years \u2013 in 2020, the central zone of the country (from Coquimbo to B\u00edo B\u00edo) experienced an average precipitation deficit of\u00a038 percent.<\/p>\n<p>Combined, the rainfall shortages and extreme heat have led to an unprecedented \u2018mega-drought\u2019 \u2013 with direct consequences for agricultural livelihoods and food security, and the health and overall quality of life of rural communities.<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"image parbase section\">\n<figure><figcaption>In the context of severe ongoing drought, the Chilean Government\u2019s efforts to secure water for vulnerable rural communities have been essential. Playing a key role are the Division of Hydraulic Works under the Ministry of Public Works and the National Irrigation Commission under the Ministry of Agriculture. Together they implement initiatives focused on the building, expansion, and improvement of rural drinking water systems that supply isolated communities disconnected from infrastructure.

These include an effort to better understand public spending on climate change-related programmes and investments (adaptation and mitigation), including those related to water access.<\/p>\n<p>Under the NDC Support Programme, UNDP has been supporting the Ministry and DIPRES to advance its climate agenda, drawing on the methodologies Climate Public Expenditure and Institutional Review (CPEIR) and\u00a0Climate Budget Tagging (CBT).<\/p>\n<p>The\u00a0results\u00a0so far include the identification of adaptation and mitigation initiatives across different ministries, including the Ministries for\u00a0Public Works,\u00a0Agriculture\u00a0and\u00a0Energy.<\/p>\n<p>For example, according to data available from the National System of Investment (Sistema Nacional de Inversiones, or SNI), 170 rural drinking water projects were developed between\u00a02016 and 2020\u00a0across the Coquimbo, Valpara\u00edso, O\u2019Higgins and the Metropolitan regions (regions that face severe water scarcity and were recently declared to be under an\u00a0agricultural emergency). More than 134 billion Chilean pesos (approximately US$6.5 billion), averaging around 27 billion pesos per year, have been channelled by the Ministry of Public Works and Regional Governments towards these projects.<\/p>\n<p>In another example, data gathered under the\u00a0Bank of Social Programmes and Non-Social Programmes\u00a0of the\u00a0Ministry of Social Development and Family\u00a0and DIPRES has revealed that of 32 programmes identified as associated with climate change, five addressed the impacts of water shortages.<\/p>\n<p>The data highlights significant government efforts already underway to address the impacts of climate change, with direct benefits for communities. However, and most importantly, the data also helps to identify the gaps, investment priorities, and policies which will allow Chile to continue to address climate change impacts in the years ahead. DIPRES has now committed to report the results annually to the Parliament.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;By classifying public spending and its contribution to climate change, it is possible to evaluate the effect of policies and activities carried out at the national level, in addition to determining the efficiency and effectiveness of budget spending\u201d, says Cristobal Gamboni, Macroeconomic and International Finance Coordinator at the Ministry of Finance.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;This classification helps generate indicators for the management of climate spending, quantifying the fiscal cost of both mitigation and adaptation measures in the long-term, making their impact visible and deciding with more information \u2013 which also enables the alignment of environmental objectives, national objectives and international commitments.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;This is why the Ministry of Finance of Chile considers it essential to have this kind of classification for public spending, giving priority to this work.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"image parbase section\">\n<figure><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"cq-dd-image \" src=\"https:\/\/www.ndcs.undp.org\/content\/ndc-support-programme\/en\/home\/impact-and-learning\/ideas-and-insights\/2021\/where-the-money-flows\/_jcr_content\/main-content\/columnControl\/col-1\/image_251329381.img.jpg\/1637663948839.jpg\" srcset=\"where-the-money-flows\/_jcr_content\/main-content\/columnControl\/col-1\/image_251329381.img.jpg\/1637663948839.jpg\" data-srcset=\"\/content\/dam\/LECB\/img\/images\/undp-ndcsp-chile-where-the-money-flows-2.jpg\/_jcr_content\/renditions\/cq5dam.web.699.470.jpeg 470w, \/content\/dam\/LECB\/img\/images\/undp-ndcsp-chile-where-the-money-flows-2.jpg\/_jcr_content\/renditions\/cq5dam.web.540.390.jpeg 390w\" data-sizes=\"auto\" data-emptytext=\"Image\" \/><figcaption>The dedication of Chile\u2019s Ministry of Finance to climate action extends to the global stage.
