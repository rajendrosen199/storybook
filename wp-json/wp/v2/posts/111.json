If I don&#8217;t drink one cup when I wake up, I&#8217;m a zombie like most people I know.

Nothing too crazy about that. I mean,\u00a0coffee didn&#8217;t make my breasts smaller, but I&#8217;m definitely sensitive to it. I know a few other people who are also sensitive to the effects of their morning coffee.<\/p>\n<p>But, as it turns out,\u00a0drinking too much coffee\u00a0may give the same effects as being drunk.<\/p>\n<div id=\"article-box-350\" class=\"block-yt-ads \" data-google-query-id=\"CI7gidbg5_8CFc0B1QodOvYOXg\">\n<div id=\"google_ads_iframe_\/1020897\/article-box-350_0__container__\">\n<h2>Can coffee make you drunk?<\/h2>\n<p>In short, yes.<\/p>\n<p>Most medical professionals will tell you to\u00a0limit your caffeine intake to 400mg a day. That translates into four cups of coffee in a 24-hour period. (I&#8217;m a java hound and even I acknowledge that it would be hard for me to ingest more than four cups in a day.)<\/p>\n<section id=\"block-yt-ads-yt-ads-atf\" class=\"block block-yt-ads contextual-links-region clearfix\">\n<div id=\"ad-inarticle-350\" data-google-query-id=\"CNX_udzg5_8CFXyIrAIdag8KZg\">\n<p>But when someone mentioned a thing called\u00a0caffeine intoxication, it all started to make sense to me. It would take eight cups of coffee to give the average person that &#8220;drunk&#8221; feeling.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Caffeine intoxication (a very real psychiatric disorder) doesn&#8217;t usually take effect until a person has ingested 1000mg of caffeine, and usually in one sitting.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>So what&#8217;s going on with me and my coffee-sensitive friends every time we have a cup of coffee and feel like we&#8217;ve been out partying at the bar all night long?<\/p>\n<h2>Why do some people feel &#8216;drunk&#8217; when they drink too much coffee?<\/h2>\n<h3>Your genetics<\/h3>\n<p>It turns out, it might be that I was just born this way \u2014 and that could be the case for you, too.<\/p>\n<section id=\"block-yt-ads-yt-ads-atftop\" class=\"block block-yt-ads contextual-links-region clearfix\">\n<div id=\"ad-inarticle-350top\" data-google-query-id=\"CJLv5Nzg5_8CFRML1QodJ4MDMA\">\n<p>A 2018 study\u00a0examined the DNA of 3,000 devoted coffee drinkers. They discovered that (in addition to being real jerks in the morning) some people in the study had a variation of\u00a0a gene called PDSS2.<\/p>\n<p>Now, that might sound like a fancy kind of video gaming console, but it&#8217;s not. PDSS2 reduces the body&#8217;s ability to break down caffeine.<\/p>\n<p><strong>That means the caffeine that&#8217;s already in your system is going to still be there when you have your second cup of coffee, your third, and your fourth.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>So while everyone else is processing their caffeine like a normal adult, you&#8217;re most likely racing around the room, because your DNA is holding on to every sip of caffeine you take and holding on to it for some higher, unforeseeable purpose.<\/p>\n<h3>Your taste buds<\/h3>\n<p>Another potential thing that could be sending you into a drunken-feeling tailspin? Some scientists believe that our taste buds are to blame.<\/p>\n<p>Because bitter tastes were originally perceived to\u00a0be threatening to early humans, the reaction of giddiness or dizziness to overly bitter tastes like coffee could be a holdover from long ago, when your taste buds could have been sending messages to your body that danger was near.<\/p>\n<div class=\"midcat-most-popular\"><\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/section>\n<\/div>\n<\/section>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>A very funny thing happens to me when I drink coffee.
