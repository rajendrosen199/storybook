Looking ahead into 2023, things should be better for the Ravens. Health alone should lead to improvement, and the change to Todd Monken at offensive coordinator should as well.<\/p>\n<p>But the defense is likely still the best unit on the team, and one of the stars of that unit &#8212; linebacker\u00a0Roquan Smith, acquired at least year&#8217;s trade deadline &#8212; sees bright things in its future.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m just excited to get out there and fly around with the guys, because I think we&#8217;re in for something special,&#8221; Smith said,\u00a0per the team&#8217;s official website. &#8220;And I think myself, personally, I think it&#8217;s going to be probably my best year, at least the way I feel physically and mentally.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Smith indicated that he and the team want to go right at the Bengals, who have now won the AFC North in back to back seasons. &#8220;We want all the smoke, honestly,&#8221; Smith said. &#8220;There&#8217;s a lot of payback that we have out there. We&#8217;ll get to it when we get to it, one week at a time.&#8221;<\/p>\n<div id=\"article-body-ad-1\" class=\"gambling-partner-ad\"><\/div>\n<p>The Ravens don&#8217;t play the Bengals in Week 1, but they don&#8217;t have to wait much longer than that. What should be one of the most anticipated rivalry games of the season is set for Week 2, when the Ravens travel to Cincinnati. The late-season rematch in Baltimore will take place on Thursday Night Football the week before Thanksgiving. Hopefully for the viewing public&#8217;s sake, we get healthy teams on both sides of the ball, and two entertaining matchups.<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div id=\"taboola-d79af511-c105-4e59-b31e-4940d576fb8f\" class=\" trc_related_container trc_spotlight_widget trc_elastic trc_elastic_thumbnails-o \" data-placement-name=\"Below Article Thumbnails Redesign\">\n<div class=\"trc_rbox_container\">\n<div>\n<div id=\"trc_wrapper_95594\" class=\"trc_rbox thumbnails-o trc-content-sponsored \">\n<div id=\"trc_header_95594\" class=\"trc_rbox_header trc_rbox_border_elm\">\n<div class=\"trc_header_ext\"><\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Last season&#8217;s\u00a0Baltimore Ravens\u00a0never quite hit their stride.
