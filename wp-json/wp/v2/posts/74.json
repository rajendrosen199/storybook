Hill entered the race second in the points.<\/p>\n<p>The start of the second stage had a caution almost immediately. Hill, who was on older tires, slid up into\u00a0Ty Gibbs, triggering an incident that collected Allmendinger and\u00a0Carson Hocevar, ending Hocevar\u2019s race. Hill was on older tires because he had put on new tires earlier after he was involved in an incident early in the first stage.
