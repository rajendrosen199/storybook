Physiologically, it&#8217;s a group effort: Diarrhea, fatigue,\u00a0headache,\u00a0nausea, and shaking are the classic symptoms. Sometimes, systolic (the upper number) blood pressure goes up, the heart beats faster than normal, and sweat glands overproduce \u2014 evidence that the &#8220;fight or flight&#8221; response is revved up. Some people become sensitive to light or sound. Others suffer a spinning sensation (vertigo).<\/p>\n<p>The result is pure misery. Fortunately, knowing the causes of hangovers, as well as different ways to cure a hangover, can help.<\/p>\n<h2>What causes hangovers?<\/h2>\n<p>The causes are as varied as the symptoms. Alcohol is metabolized into acetaldehyde, a substance that&#8217;s toxic at high levels. However, concentrations rarely get that high, so that&#8217;s not the complete explanation.<\/p>\n<p>Drinking interferes with brain activity during sleep, so a hangover may be a form of\u00a0sleep deprivation. Alcohol scrambles the hormones that regulate our biological clocks, which may be why a hangover can feel like\u00a0jet lag, and vice versa. Alcohol can also trigger\u00a0migraines, so some people may think they&#8217;re hung over when it&#8217;s really an alcohol-induced migraine they&#8217;re suffering.<\/p>\n<p>Hangovers begin after blood alcohol levels start to fall. In fact, according to some experts, the worst symptoms occur when levels reach zero.<\/p>\n<p>The key ingredient seems to be &#8220;drinking to intoxication&#8221;; how much you drank to get there is less important. In fact, several studies suggest that light and moderate drinkers are more vulnerable to getting a hangover than heavy drinkers. Yet there&#8217;s also seemingly contradictory research showing that people with a family history of alcoholism have worse hangovers. Researchers say some people may end up with drinking problems because they drink in an effort to relieve hangover symptoms.<\/p>\n<div class=\"inline-ad not-prose\">\n<div class=\"border-t border-gray-400\"><\/div>\n<div class=\"px-6 py-10 md:py-12 md:px-10 xl:p-20 xl:!px-12 xl:!py-14 image-link-wrapper max-w-md-lg mx-auto\">\n<div class=\"max-w-screen-xl mx-auto\">\n<div class=\"sm:grid sm:grid-cols-3 sm:gap-8\">\n<div class=\"sm:col-span-2\">\n<h2>7 hangover remedies<\/h2>\n<p>Obviously, not drinking any alcohol is the best solution. But if you do drink, here are simple tips to help prevent and relieve the misery.<\/p>\n<p><strong>1. Drinking fluids<em>.<\/em><\/strong>\u00a0Alcohol promotes urination because it inhibits the release of vasopressin, a hormone that decreases the volume of urine made by the kidneys. If your hangover includes diarrhea, sweating, or vomiting, you may be even more dehydrated. Although nausea can make it difficult to get anything down, even just a few sips of water might help your hangover.<\/p>\n<p><strong>2. Getting some carbohydrates into your system<em>.<\/em><\/strong>\u00a0Drinking may lower blood sugar levels, so theoretically some of the fatigue and headaches of a hangover may be from a brain working without enough of its main fuel. Moreover, many people forget to eat when they drink, further lowering their blood sugar. Toast and juice is a way to gently nudge levels back to normal.<\/p>\n<p><strong>3. Avoiding darker-colored alcoholic beverages<em>.<\/em><\/strong>\u00a0Experiments have shown that clear liquors, such as vodka and gin, tend to cause hangovers less frequently than dark ones, such as whiskey, red wine, and tequila. The main form of alcohol in alcoholic beverages is ethanol, but the darker liquors contain chemically related compounds (congeners), including methanol. The same enzymes process ethanol and methanol, but methanol metabolites are especially toxic, so they may cause a worse hangover.<\/p>\n<p><strong>4. Taking a pain reliever \u2014 but not Tylenol<em>.<\/em><\/strong>\u00a0Aspirin, ibuprofen (Motrin, other brands), and other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) may help with the headache and the overall achy feelings. NSAIDs, though, may irritate a stomach already irritated by alcohol. Don&#8217;t take acetaminophen (Tylenol): if alcohol is lingering in your system, it may accentuate acetaminophen&#8217;s toxic effects on the liver.<\/p>\n<p><strong>5. Drinking coffee or tea<em>.<\/em><\/strong>\u00a0Caffeine may not have any special anti-hangover powers, but as a stimulant, it could help with the grogginess. However, it&#8217;s important to keep in mind that\u00a0caffeine and alcohol should never be mixed\u00a0because the caffeine can mask the depressant effects of alcohol, making drinkers feel more alert than they would otherwise.<\/p>\n<p><strong>6. Taking B vitamins and zinc<em>.<\/em><\/strong>\u00a0A study published in\u00a0<em>The Journal of Clinical Medicine<\/em>\u00a0evaluated the diets for 24 hours before and after excessive drinking occurred. It was a small study and results were based on the participants saying what they ate. However, they did find that people whose food and beverage consumption contained greater amounts of zinc and B vitamins had less severe hangovers.<\/p>\n<p><strong>7. Hair of the dog.\u00a0<\/strong>Drinking to ease the symptoms of a hangover is sometimes called taking the hair of the dog, or hair of the dog that bit you. The notion is that hangovers are a form of alcohol withdrawal, so a drink or two will ease the withdrawal. However, the hair of the dog just perpetuates a cycle. It doesn&#8217;t allow you to recover.<\/p>\n<h2>How to prevent hangovers<\/h2>\n<p>Hangovers affects individuals differently. For example, the effects of alcohol on a smaller person will usually be greater than on a larger person. These tips may help you\u00a0prevent having a hangover\u00a0when drinking alcohol:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Drink slowly and on a full stomach.<\/li>\n<li>Drink in moderation.<\/li>\n<li>Women should have no more than 1 drink per day and men no more than 2 drinks per day. One drink is defined as 12 fluid ounces (360 milliliters) of beer that has about 5% alcohol, 5 fluid ounces (150 milliliters) of wine that has about 12% alcohol, or 1 1\/2 fluid ounces (45 milliliters) of 80-proof liquor.<\/li>\n<li>Drink a glass of water in between drinks containing alcohol. This will help you drink less alcohol and decrease\u00a0dehydration\u00a0from drinking alcohol.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Hangovers seem to be the body&#8217;s way of reminding us about the hazards of overindulgence.
