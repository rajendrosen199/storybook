The federal government also recently announced plans to offload some buildings from its portfolio of properties in downtown Ottawa.<\/p>\n<p class=\"l-longform-article__p l-longform-article__content l-longform-article__content--narrow \">The dwindling of public servants \u2014 once the lifeblood for businesses in the downtown core \u2014 is troubling to Sutcliffe.<\/p>\n<blockquote class=\"l-longform-article__blockquote l-longform-article__content l-longform-article__content--narrow c-longform-blockquote l-article__blockquote c-longform-tweet-button \">\n<div class=\"\">\n<p class=\"c-longform-blockquote__content l-article__blockquoteContent\">\u201cI think, more than ever, the future of downtown Ottawa is in doubt,\u201d he said.<\/p>\n<div class=\"c-longform-blockquote__quote\"><\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p class=\"l-longform-article__p l-longform-article__content l-longform-article__content--narrow \">\u201cIf there\u2019s an opportunity to find a spot for an arena, that could be a major attraction that would bring people downtown, that would be good for businesses in the downtown core, then I think we should at least consider it.\u201d<\/p>\n<p class=\"l-longform-article__p l-longform-article__content l-longform-article__content--narrow \">Ottawa city council would have to sign off on such a development, as would the Government of Canada and National Capital Commission if federal land were used for the deal.<\/p>\n<p class=\"l-longform-article__p l-longform-article__content l-longform-article__content--narrow \">Sutcliffe did not rule out LeBreton Flats as a viable alternative, though NHL Commissioner Gary Bettman said in a trip to Ottawa in March that he felt the parcel of land set aside for a possible arena \u201cstruck (him) as a little bit small.\u201d<\/p>\n<p class=\"l-longform-article__p l-longform-article__content l-longform-article__content--narrow \">Ever since Sutcliffe floated the idea of a downtown arena in interviews with media last week, the capital\u2019s business community has been buzzing about whether there\u2019s even enough space in the core to make such a pitch into reality.<\/p>\n<p class=\"l-longform-article__p l-longform-article__content l-longform-article__content--narrow \">Shawn Hamilton, principal of Proveras Commercial Realty in Ottawa, tells Global News that there\u2019s \u201c100 per cent\u201d space for the Sens downtown.<\/p>\n<p class=\"l-longform-article__p l-longform-article__content l-longform-article__content--narrow \">As an example, Hamilton says he recently took a look at the site of the old Ottawa Technical High School on Alberta Street and compared it to arenas in downtown Toronto and Montreal \u2014 the land there would be a fit for such an arena, in his estimation, with good access to the city\u2019s light-rail transit system nearby.<\/p>\n<p class=\"l-longform-article__p l-longform-article__content l-longform-article__content--narrow \">While Hamilton believes LeBreton Flats is still a \u201csolid alternative\u201d if the Sens end up playing there, he agrees with Sutcliffe that the context for a new arena has changed in the past three years since the pandemic began.<\/p>\n<p class=\"l-longform-article__p l-longform-article__content l-longform-article__content--narrow \">While businesses need support in the form of a new reason for people to come downtown, he says there\u2019s a wider city-building lens. A major events centre could spur new residential development and bring amenities that previously didn\u2019t exist in an area first built primarily to cater to public servants, he says.<\/p>\n<p class=\"l-longform-article__p l-longform-article__content l-longform-article__content--narrow \">\u201cOttawa really is in need of a shot in the arm to sort of establish and reinvigorate the whole

\">Sutcliffe told Global News on Tuesday that he hadn\u2019t had the chance to speak with Andlauer about prospects for the Sens new arena, adding that the ideas are \u201cvery preliminary\u201d and he\u2019s there to \u201cfacilitate\u201d talks between the many parties that need to align on the vision for such a project.<\/p>\n<p class=\"l-longform-article__p l-longform-article__content l-longform-article__content--narrow \">\u201cI think with a new owner now, it\u2019s a new chapter for the Ottawa Senators,\u201d he said.<\/p>\n<p class=\"l-longform-article__p l-longform-article__content l-longform-article__content--narrow \">Global News also reached out to the Ottawa Senators to ask if Andlauer would weigh in on the matter, but were told the owner-to-be is not taking media questions yet.<\/p>\n<p class=\"l-longform-article__p l-longform-article__content l-longform-article__content--narrow \">But Ann Pegoraro, Lang Chair in Sport Management at the University of Guelph, says it makes sense that the new owners would want to build a fresh arena for the team \u2014 and one as centrally located as possible.<\/p>\n<p class=\"l-longform-article__p l-longform-article__content l-longform-article__content--narrow \">Pegoraro says there\u2019s typically a \u201choneymoon period\u201d for professional sports organizations after migrating to a new arena that nets a bump in ticket sales and revenue from fresh sponsorships. That boost in cash can then flow back into the team and improve the club\u2019s prospects in turn, hopefully fuelling a winning cycle for the new owners.<\/p>\n<p class=\"l-longform-article__p l-longform-article__content l-longform-article__content--narrow \">Downtown arenas used to be the norm for professional sports clubs, but a wave of building in recent decades saw venues relocate to the suburbs, Pegoraro explains, with the belief that fans would drive out and park at a stadium closer to their homes.<\/p>\n<p class=\"l-longform-article__p l-longform-article__content l-longform-article__content--narrow \">Momentum has swung back towards centrally located arenas, however, in an effort to offer fans a more complete experience when they head to the game or a concert in the same venue, she says. The Arizona Coyotes have played in the suburbs for years and have long struggled to secure a suitable downtown venue for the franchise, for example.<\/p>\n<p class=\"l-longform-article__p l-longform-article__content l-longform-article__content--narrow \">With a more fulsome \u201csports and entertainment district,\u201d she notes, fans can head out for an afternoon of shopping, grab dinner and a drink before or after the game and take public transit back home \u2014 all the while, visiting a series of local businesses and livening up the core.<\/p>\n<p class=\"l-longform-article__p l-longform-article__content l-longform-article__content--narrow \">\u201cThey become this sort-of drawing point where even if there isn\u2019t a game on, there are restaurants, there are social avenues, there are outside parts to this that people could congregate around,\u201d Pegoraro says.<\/p>\n<p class=\"l-longform-article__p l-longform-article__content l-longform-article__content--narrow \">Conversations about the sustainability of massive sports arenas have also shifted recently, Pegoraro says.<\/p>\n<p class=\"l-longform-article__p l-longform-article__content l-longform-article__content--narrow \">Instead of a focus on sustainable materials and alternative forms of energy, she says that the location of the arena \u2014 and whether fans are driving and parking cars there or walking and taking public transit \u2014 has become a much bigger focus when weighing a project\u2019s overall carbon footprint.<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<div

class=\"l-longform-article__p l-longform-article__content l-longform-article__content--narrow \">For all the talk of upsides to putting a major events centre in downtown Ottawa, the cost of such a
