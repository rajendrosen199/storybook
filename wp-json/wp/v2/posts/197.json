Ticketmaster has once again cracked under the weight of a Taylor Swift ticket sale \u2014 this time in France.<\/p>\n<p>As French fans prepared on Tuesday to purchase tickets to six concerts in May and June 2024 on Swift\u2019s Eras Tour \u2014 four shows in Paris, two in Lyon \u2014 Ticketmaster\u2019s website displayed a gigantic queue of customers ready to buy; one screenshot appeared to tell a fan that 1,023,504 shoppers were in line ahead of them.<\/p>\n<p>Soon, Ticketmaster announced that sales for those shows had been placed on \u201cpause.\u201d The company said that a new on-sale time would be announced, and that \u201call codes not already used will remain valid.\u201d But some fans\u2019 social media posts seemed to show technical errors on Ticketmaster\u2019s website, including a progress icon that \u201ckeeps spinning and spinning and spinning,\u201d as one fan \u2014 speaking English with an American accent, but with 762 euros\u2019 worth of tickets in their shopping cart \u2014 put it.<\/p>\n<p>A few hours later, the French branch of Ticketmaster offered some more detail on social media, blaming the problem on a \u201cthird-party provider\u201d that the company did not identify, and adding that tickets were still available. A representative of Live Nation Entertainment, Ticketmaster\u2019s corporate parent, said that the provider works with Ticketmaster only in France.<\/p>\n<p>The situation in France appeared to be a frustrating repeat of the problems that plagued Swift\u2019s North American presale in November, when an influx of millions of fans \u2014 and bots \u2014 overwhelmed Ticketmaster\u2019s systems, and fans reported issues like tickets in their shopping carts disappearing before they could be purchased. Ticketmaster shut down its public sale as a result, though the company also said it had sold more than two million tickets to the tour in a single day.<\/p>\n<p>Problems like those at Swift\u2019s presale in November \u2014 as well as long-simmering concerns over Ticketmaster and Live Nation\u2019s market dominance \u2014 led to a brutal Senate Judiciary hearing in January. Senators from both parties flatly called the company a monopoly and were skeptical of an executive\u2019s explanation that Ticketmaster was unable to defend itself against an onslaught of bots during Swift\u2019s presale.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThis is unbelievable,\u201d Senator Marsha Blackburn, Republican of Tennessee, said at the hearing. \u201cWhy is it,\u201d she added, \u201cthat you have not developed an algorithm to sort out what is a bot and what is a consumer?\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Yet the demand for Swift tickets has been extraordinary, with Swift selling out stadiums everywhere she plays and tickets going for thousands of dollars on the secondary market. She is scheduled to complete the North American leg of her tour next month, then play in Latin America, Asia and Europe.<\/p>\n<p>The Justice Department has separately been conducting an antitrust investigation of Live Nation. The Justice Department has not confirmed that investigation, but Live Nation\u2019s chief executive, Michael Rapino, has spoken about it openly.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Fans trying to purchase tickets to six of the pop superstar\u2019s concerts faced long queues and technical issues before the company said that a new on-sale time would be announced.
