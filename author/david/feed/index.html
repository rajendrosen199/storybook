<p><span>Le choc de Ligue 1 du Paris Saint-Germain contre l&#8217;Olympique Lyonnais dimanche serait normalement l&#8217;un des grands rendez-vous du match français. Cependant, en raison de la combinaison de la fin prématurée de la saison des hôtes après un autre désastre en UEFA Champions League et de la longue période de difficultés du visiteur, le match a un peu moins d&#8217;éclat que d&#8217;habitude. Le PSG a perdu deux de ses trois derniers matchs toutes compétitions confondues tandis que Lyon est sans victoire dans la même période et Laurent Blanc revient au Parc des Princes pour diriger une équipe actuellement à neuf points de la qualification européenne. Christophe Galtier affronte l&#8217;entraîneur le plus victorieux des Parisiens sous une pression importante en raison de la déception de l&#8217;UCL et de la Coupe de France alors que la coupe nationale pourrait encore sauver la saison de l&#8217;OL.</span></p>
<p><span>&#8220;Lyon est l&#8217;une des grandes équipes, et elle s&#8217;améliore match après match&#8221;, </span><span>a déclaré Galtier à propos des Gones avant le match</span><span> . &#8220;Ils ont une demi-finale de Coupe de France à jouer quelques jours plus tard, ce qui est un objectif important pour eux, mais ils viennent au Parc ce dimanche avec des joueurs de niveau international, des jeunes qui s&#8217;expriment bien cette saison. Ce sera Ce sera un match difficile contre l&#8217;une des meilleures équipes de la ligue.</span></p>
<p><span>&#8220;Nous avons eu 10 jours pour travailler avec un nombre limité de joueurs. Nous avons soigné les petits blessés, les joueurs reviennent petit à petit. Demain nous aurons une séance axée sur le jeu. PSG-OL, c&#8217;est un classique rendez-vous dans cette ligue. Il faut renouer avec la victoire après Rennes et se remettre sur les rails dans le sprint final. Nous parlons beaucoup de la préparation de la saison prochaine, nous discutons avec Luis Campos et le président, mais je Je me concentre principalement sur les dix derniers matchs de la saison, en cherchant à décrocher le titre.</span></p>
<p><span>&#8220;Nous aborderons ces prochains matches avec détermination et lucidité. Si nous sommes performants lors des trois prochains matches, nous aurons un avantage significatif. Il ne faut pas choisir la facilité, tout peut aller très vite, il faut donc être Il faut être vigilant et il faut entretenir l&#8217;envie de gagner des matches, l&#8217;envie de remporter ce titre. Quand on regarde le calendrier, on affrontera plus tard des équipes qui luttent pour la survie, ou des prétendants au podium, et il y aura beaucoup de matches à fort enjeu pour tout le monde impliqué.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><strong><span>PSG :</span></strong><span> Neymar et Presnel Kimpembe sont des absents de longue durée mais Achraf Hakimi est revenu avec le Maroc tandis que Marquinhos est soigné. </span><span>Carlos Soler et Nordi Mukiele ont été exclus en raison de leurs blessures respectives</span><span> mais Sergio Ramos pourrait encore revenir.</span></p>
<p><span>&#8220;Pendant la pause, Neymar est venu faire une évaluation post-opératoire de sa cheville&#8221;, a ajouté Galtier. &#8220;Nous discutons beaucoup avec lui, nous suivons évidemment son processus de rééducation. Lorsqu&#8217;il y a une blessure comme celle-ci, j&#8217;aime laisser un peu d&#8217;espace au joueur, mais nous restons évidemment en contact très régulièrement.</span></p>
<p><span>&#8220;Nous regardons bien sûr les matchs, d&#8217;abord en tant que supporters de l&#8217;équipe de France, et nous regardons aussi les performances de nos joueurs. Léo a marqué son 800ème but et son 100ème but en équipe nationale, Achraf a pu jouer contre le Brésil. , ce qui lui a fait du bien physiquement et mentalement. On espère toujours que les joueurs reviendront sans blessure. On a toujours cette appréhension mais ça n&#8217;a pas été le cas cette fois-ci.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Lyon :</span></strong><span> Malo Gusto et Anthony Lopes pourraient être absents même si ce dernier n&#8217;est pas encore exclu après son retour à l&#8217;entraînement. Le vétéran Rémy Riou pourrait continuer si Lopes n&#8217;y parvient pas tandis que Sael Kumbedi est le remplaçant à long terme de Gusto pour l&#8217;OL et devrait obtenir le feu vert ici.</span></p>

<h2><span>Prédiction</span></h2>
<p><span>Le PSG devrait avoir de quoi battre Lyon mais cela dépend vraiment de son état d&#8217;esprit. Une pause dans la déception d&#8217;un début d&#8217;année 2023 difficile aurait dû faire du bien aux hommes de Galtier tandis que les hommes de Blanc savent qu&#8217;ils ont une tâche difficile à accomplir. Les champions devraient gagner celui-ci par un but ou deux. </span><strong><span>Choix :</span></strong><span> PSG 3, Lyon 1.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>After a grueling Leagues Cup run, Lionel Messi and Inter Miami seemed to be running on fumes, but they continue to conjure just enough magic required each time they step on the field. In the U.S. Open Cup semifinals on the road against FC Cincinnati, the run would live on.</p>
<p>Inter Miami fell 2-0 down to the physical MLS table-toppers, who looked every bit a Supporters&#8217; Shield leader for the first hour, but Messi provided two assists to Leo Campana for a late comeback, with the second coming seven minutes deep into added time to draw level at 2-2.</p>
<p><a href="https://dazntv.online/US/"><img decoding="async" class=" wp-image-230 aligncenter" src="http://storybook.spectator.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/EFCm-1-300x77.gif" alt="Lafc vs inter miami Live" width="347" height="89" /></a></p>
<p>Josef Martinez struck early in extra-time on a feed from substitute Benji Cremaschi to give Inter Miami the lead, but Yuya Kubo grabbed his own equalizer in the 114th minute to pull FC Cincinnati back even.</p>
<p>In the penalty shootout, Callender stopped Nick Hagglund&#8217;s effort in the fifth round to set up the win, and Cremaschi scored his spot-kick to send Inter Miami through to yet another Cup final, just days after securing the club&#8217;s first-ever trophy and keep Messi unbeaten in pink.</p>
<p>Like Nashville SC before them, FC Cincinnati battered Inter Miami early and often, but they failed to capitalize on a host of chances to put the game away, and that would haunt them in the end.</p>

<h2><strong>FC Cincinnati vs Inter Miami</strong> live updates, highlights, commentary</h2>
<h3>FC Cincinnati vs. Inter Miami: Penalty shootout</h3>
<p><strong><u>Round 5</u></strong></p>
<p><strong>FC Cincinnati:</strong> The hosts send another defender up in <strong>Nick Hagglund</strong>, and his effort is&#8230;<u><em>SAVED</em></u>! DRAKE CALLENDER MAKES THE SAVE! It&#8217;s a poor penalty, far too central, and Callender picks it out easily!</p>
<p><strong>Inter Miami:</strong> Here&#8217;s 18-year-old <strong>Benji Cremaschi</strong> who assisted the go-ahead goal in extra-time, and the young midfielder&#8230;<u><em>SCORES</em></u>! INTER MIAMI ADVANCE!</p>
<div id="adPlaceholder-1"></div>
<div class="twitter-tweet twitter-tweet-rendered"></div>
<p><b><u>Round 4</u></b></p>
<p><strong>FC Cincinnati:</strong> USMNT defender <strong>Matt Miazga</strong> steps up wearing the captain&#8217;s armband, and he&#8230;<u><em>SCORES</em></u>! He sends Callender the wrong way!</p>
<p><strong>Inter Miami:</strong> Next is striker <strong>Josef Martinez</strong>, who&#8230;<u><em>SCORES</em></u>! He got Alec Kann tied up in knots, and with the goalkeeper rooted, he deposits the delivery.</p>
<p><strong><u>Round 3</u></strong></p>
<p><strong>FC Cincinnati:</strong> Here is <strong>Sergio Santos</strong> who&#8230;<u><em>SCORES</em></u>! Another top-shelf rip, unstoppable penalty.</p>
<p><strong>Inter Miami:</strong> Now it&#8217;s another youngster for Inter Miami, as <strong>David Ruiz</strong>&#8230;<u><em>SCORES</em></u>! A stutter step is followed by yet <em>another</em> howitzer of a penalty. Nobody&#8217;s missed yet!</p>
<p><strong><u>Round 2</u></strong></p>
<p><strong>FC Cincinnati:</strong> Up next is <strong>Santiago Arias</strong> who&#8230;<u><em>SCORES</em></u>! He sends Callender the wrong way.</p>
<div id="adPlaceholder-2"></div>
<p><strong>Inter Miami:</strong> On his Inter Miami debut it&#8217;s <strong>Facundo Farias </strong>to step up, and the 20-year-old <u><em>SCORES</em></u>! It&#8217;s an absolute blast into the top corner.</p>
<p><strong><u>Round 1</u></strong></p>
<p><strong>FC Cincinnati:</strong> FC Cincinnati win the toss, and Matt Miazga elects to shoot first. Stepping up first is <strong>Yuya Kubo</strong> who scored the equalizer. He&#8230;<em><u>SCORES</u></em>! Low and hard to the right, Drake Callender guesses right but is late to dive.</p>
<p><strong>Inter Miami:</strong> Of course it&#8217;s <b>Lionel Messi</b> up first for Inter Miami, as he was each of the last two times, and he&#8230;<u><em>SCORES</em></u>! He chips it left and sends Alec Kann the wrong way.</p>
<div class="twitter-tweet twitter-tweet-rendered"></div>
<h3>END OF EXTRA-TIME: FC Cincinnati 3-3 Inter Miami</h3>
<p>To penalties we go! Inter Miami climbed all the way back from a 2-0 deficit to take the lead, but FC Cincinnati wouldn&#8217;t die either, and the 120 minutes finish level. Bring on the shootout! Lionel Messi has emerged victorious from both his previous penalty shootouts with Inter Miami in the Leagues Cup, including the final. Drake Callender has been fantastic so far.</p>
<div class="twitter-tweet twitter-tweet-rendered"></div>
<h3>FC Cincinnati vs. Inter Miami: Extra time</h3>
<p><strong>117th min:</strong> Ohhhh boy, we&#8217;re in Messi free-kick territory. David Ruiz carves his way right down FC Cincinnati&#8217;s throat, and is eventually fouled centrally outside the top of the penalty area. Messi steps up and hits it well, but he can&#8217;t find the top corner this time, seeing his blast instead fall into the goalkeeper&#8217;s grasp.</p>
<p><a id="3-3" role="presentation" name="3-3" aria-hidden="true"></a><strong>114th min: GOAL! FC CINCINNATI!</strong> INTER MIAMI AREN&#8217;T THE ONLY ONES CAPABLE OF A LATE COMEBACK! The visitors are punished for trying to see out the game, and Yuya Kubo takes advantage of a deflected cross which falls at his feet, taking one touch onto his right foot and blasting it into the top corner from 15 yards out. WE&#8217;RE LEVEL AGAIN!</p>
<div id="adPlaceholder-3"></div>
<div class="twitter-tweet twitter-tweet-rendered"></div>
<p><strong>112th min:</strong> Inter Miami are looking to kill the game by taking the air out of the ball. Every time they get it, the ball gets cycled back through the defense and eventually the goalkeeper. They have no intention of playing the ball forward unless they absolutely have to. FC Cincinnati are attacking as best they can, but Sergio Santos and Yuya Kubo seem to be running out of ideas.</p>
<p><strong>108th min:</strong> Lionel Messi is just showing off now. He&#8217;s dribbling through multiple defenders just trying to eat clock and buy his team a few more seconds to rest. The crowd has a cheer once he&#8217;s finally dispossessed, but he accomplished his goal.</p>
<p><strong>Kickoff:</strong> Santiago Arias, just moments after rattling the crossbar, is substituted off in FC Cincinnati&#8217;s final change, with Bret Halsey entering.</p>
<div class="twitter-tweet twitter-tweet-rendered"></div>
<p><strong>HALFTIME: </strong>The referee blows the whistle and boos rain down, but the TQL Stadium fans are a bit biased, and they won&#8217;t want to admit that&#8217;s the right call. FC Cincinnati have been electric since falling behind, but the clock is their enemy. Inter Miami will have to dig deep to hold this lead, there&#8217;s no more substitutes left for Tata Martino to make.</p>
<div class="twitter-tweet twitter-tweet-rendered"></div>
<p><strong>104th min: Chance, FC Cincinnati!</strong> THE HOSTS HIT THE POST! A corner is swung in and the header from Santiago Arias clatters the woodwork! That&#8217;s a thumping effort but it clangs the crossbar!</p>
<p>Then moments later on the recycle, FC Cincinnati players are screaming for a penalty after a Nick Hagglund shot hits the arm of a defender, but it&#8217;s very clearly sucked in on his chest and there&#8217;s nothing in that at all. VAR has a look but play continues with no penalty, which is the correct call.</p>
<p><strong>102nd min:</strong> Nick Hagglund makes a run down the flank and delivers a cross with Sergio Santos making a run, but the ball is too tight to the goalkeeper and Drake Callender has it in his grasp. It&#8217;s been all FC Cincinnati since the Inter Miami goal.</p>
<div id="adPlaceholder-4"></div>
<p><strong>97th min:</strong> FC Cincinnati have responded brightly to falling behind, but Robert Taylor makes a great tackle at pace to prevent a cross on his flank. Sergio Busquets gives it a round of applause.</p>
<p><a id="2-3" role="presentation" name="2-3" aria-hidden="true"></a><strong>93rd min: GOAL! INTER MIAMI!</strong> THEY&#8217;VE TURNED IT AROUND! It&#8217;s the substitute Benji Cremaschi who makes it happen, receiving the ball in midfield with his back to goal and turning wonderfully, creating space before feeding a vertical ball to Josef Martinez who does the rest with the finish.</p>
<div class="twitter-tweet twitter-tweet-rendered"></div>
<p><strong>Kickoff:</strong> FC Cincinnati are in a bit of trouble now. They have withdrawn all three of their attackers, especially Luciano Acosta, who appeared completely out of gas. They&#8217;ll need to have others step up if they are to win this and reach the final.</p>
<p>Tata Martino uses his additional extra-time sub immediately, bringing Benji Cremaschi on for Leonardo Campana.</p>
<h3>END OF REGULATION: FC Cincinnati 2-2 Inter Miami</h3>
<p>FC Cincinnati dominated long stretches of this match, and seemed good enough for victory over Inter Miami, but Lionel Messi just refused to quit, and his deep assist conjures up a comeback.</p>
<p>The hosts are punished for not going to the corner flag and eating up the final seconds. Incredible. 30 more minutes are on the horizon!</p>
<div class="twitter-tweet twitter-tweet-rendered"></div>
<h3><strong>FC Cincinnati vs Inter Miami: </strong>Second Half</h3>
<p><a id="2-2" role="presentation" name="2-2" aria-hidden="true"></a><b>90+7 min: GOAL! INTER MIAMI!</b> YOU CAN&#8217;T BE SERIOUS! LEO MESSI ASSISTS LEONARDO CAMPANA AGAIN AND WE&#8217;RE LEVEL JUST SECONDS FROM THE END OF THE MATCH! A deep cross to the far post is right onto Campana&#8217;s head, and while Alec Kann got a fingertip to it, he can&#8217;t keep it out!</p>
<div id="adPlaceholder-5"></div>
<p>Messi has saved this team again and surely we&#8217;re going to extra-time!</p>
<div class="twitter-tweet twitter-tweet-rendered"></div>
<div class="twitter-tweet twitter-tweet-rendered"></div>
<p><strong>90+5 min:</strong> Inter Miami are out of ideas. Lionel Messi tries to do it all himself from midfield, but he&#8217;s sandwiched and dispossessed. FC Cincinnati nearly put it away on the break but a heavy touch by Marco Angulo sees it evaporate.</p>
<p><strong>89th min:</strong> Alvaro Barreal is booked for wildly swinging his boot at the ball while laying on the ground. A whopping eight minutes of added time are shown! That&#8217;s so much!</p>
<p><strong>86th min:</strong> Luciano Acosta is booked for accumulation as he fouls Leo Campana with a push from behind. FC Cincinnati are readying a triple substitution, but choose not to do it just yet.</p>
<p>Eventually, Raymon Gaddis, Marco Angulo, and Alvas Powell all come on. Luciano Acosta is one of those withdrawn, as he hands off the captain&#8217;s armband and limps off.</p>
<div class="twitter-tweet twitter-tweet-rendered"></div>
<p><strong>82nd min:</strong> Goodness, Inter Miami survive another scare after switching off defensively. Luciano Acosta is again a creative force in feeding a great cross in front of net, but it&#8217;s just out of reach of his teammate streaking in front of goal.</p>
<p><strong>80th min:</strong> Serhiy Kryvtsov picks up a booking for a bad foul on Alvaro Barreal, on whom the Ukrainian defender commits a clearly intentional foul in midfield having been skinned on the break. In the aftermath, Tata Martino is also booked, and I&#8217;m not sure what he could be arguing about.</p>
<p><strong>78th min:</strong> Out of the second half cooling break, Inter Miami makes another two changes. Josef Martinez replaces Diego Gomez, while Noah Allen also enters for Tomas Aviles in defense. FC Cincinnati counters by taking off Brandon Vazquez for Sergio Santos.</p>
<div id="adPlaceholder-6"></div>
<p><strong>74th min: Chance, FC Cincinnati!</strong> Yuya Kubo is causing so many problems! Luciano Acosta finds him on a through ball, and while the Inter Miami wave for offside, Kubo blasts one on net that forces Drake Callender into a huge save while far from his net! Inter Miami have survived a few body blows here since their goal, and have to be careful of giving it right back.</p>
<div class="twitter-tweet twitter-tweet-rendered"></div>
<p><strong>72nd min: Chance, FC Cincinnati!</strong> The hosts have a goal chalked off for the second time today! Yuya Kubo deflects a corner into the back of the net, but the whistle blows! I think it&#8217;s for handball, which is incredibly harsh, but the correct call based on the rules. The ball clips up off Kubo&#8217;s thigh and into his arm before he settles, and as an attacker, that&#8217;s enough to ruled out. Unlucky!</p>
<p><strong>70th min:</strong> FC Cincinnati have a dangerous free-kick of their own as Tomas Aviles is booked for taking down Brandon Vazquez just outside the 18-yard box. Alvaro Barreal comes very close, but Drake Callender had it covered, tipping the ball over the end line past the far post.</p>
<p><a id="2-1" role="presentation" name="2-1" aria-hidden="true"></a><strong>68th min: GOAL! INTER MIAMI!</strong> GAME ON! Facundo Farias is flattened out wide to win a free-kick. On the set-piece, Lionel Messi picks up his second Inter Miami assist as he finds the head of Leo Campana for a <em>thumping</em> finish! Messi put that right on a platter for his strike partner!</p>
<div class="twitter-tweet twitter-tweet-rendered"></div>
<p><strong>63rd min:</strong> FC Cincinnati make their first change, with Yuya Kubo entering the field for Aaron Boupendza. He&#8217;s involved immediately, but a through-ball takes him just too wide and his shot is right into Drake Callender&#8217;s bread basket.</p>
<p><strong>60th min:</strong> The new Inter Miami shape is their more traditional 4-3-3. Robert Taylor is playing right-back, while David Ruiz goes into midfield and Facundo Farias, on for his first appearance for the club, is going to help Messi pull strings up front.</p>
<p><strong>56th min:</strong> Tata Martino may regret not making any halftime substitutions. He readies a triple substitution immediately after the goal. Robert Taylor will be one of the players to come on shortly, replacing defender Kamal Miller, which signals a change in formation. DeAndre Yedlin and Jean Mota are also withdrawn, replaced by David Ruiz and Inter Miami debutant Facundo Farias.</p>
<div id="adPlaceholder-7"></div>
<p><a id="2-0" role="presentation" name="2-0" aria-hidden="true"></a><strong>53rd min: GOAL! FC CINCINNATI!</strong> Off a pinball counter, it&#8217;s Brandon Vazquez with a low, driven finish from outside the box! The USMNT striker didn&#8217;t appear to be in a terribly dangerous position, but no Inter Miami defender steps to him trailing the play, and he rifles a shot perfectly inside the far post.</p>
<div class="twitter-tweet twitter-tweet-rendered"></div>
<p><strong>49th min:</strong> Diego Gomez wins a foul as he gets to the ball before Aaron Boupendza, and then takes an elbow to the back. Inter Miami frustration with the physicality is starting to bubble over, as Serhiy Kryvtsov comes in and has words with Boupendza. It&#8217;s not inconceivable for this match to reach a boiling point soon.</p>
<p><strong>Kickoff:</strong> FC Cincinnati kick the second half off as Lionel Messi is tying is boots. No changes for Inter Miami, as Gerardo Martino is (for now) sticking with his original plan. It wasn&#8217;t a bright first 45 minutes, but they only trail by one, and we all know what Lionel Messi can do at any point.</p>
<h3>HALFTIME: FC Cincinnati 1-0 Inter Miami</h3>
<p>The hosts possess the rest of the way and take the air out of the ball, all the way to the halftime whistle. Lionel Messi appears clearly frustrated as he walks to the tunnel, after a 45-minute spell kept entirely in check. Messi finished that half with just 32 touches, and while he was tidy in possession, he did little to create much in front of goal, either for himself or others.</p>
<p>FC Cincinnati were very physical in that half, but unlike other prior Inter Miami opponents, they kept their heads, avoided bad fouls, and frustrated the Messi-led squad to its detriment. A statement from the hosts through 45 minutes, but it&#8217;s far from over. Let&#8217;s see what Tata Martino has in store, despite having just seven available players on the bench in this competition.</p>
<div class="twitter-tweet twitter-tweet-rendered"></div>
<h3><strong>FC Cincinnati vs Inter Miami: </strong>First Half</h3>
<p><strong>45+3 min:</strong> This is getting <i>very</i> physical. Sergio Busquets first commits a foul, and then is clipped moments after the restart. It hasn&#8217;t boiled over yet, but both teams — Inter Miami in particular — are voicing clear frustration.</p>
<p>Diego Gomez heads DeAndre Yedlin&#8217;s cross well over the crossbar.</p>
<div id="adPlaceholder-8"></div>
<p><strong>44th min:</strong> FC Cincinnati have done very well to limit Lionel Messi, as the Argentine has just 23 touches so far. Against other teams, role players on Inter Miami stepped up to punish the added attention on Messi, but here, with multiple changes to the lineup, there&#8217;s not been anyone to carry the load.</p>
<p>Jean Mota sends a deep cross miles over the penalty area and over the end line on the fly. So disjointed for Inter Miami thus far, as the FC Cincinnati defense looks comfortable. 6 minutes of added time is shown.</p>
<p><strong>41st min:</strong> A third booking of the first half, and second to Inter Miami, as Jean Mota gets a yellow for catching Obinna Nwobodo late. It&#8217;s not dangerous, but a caution is well-earned as Mota stuck his leg <em>very</em> far out, and was really in no position to make a tackle there.</p>
<p><strong>36th min:</strong> There&#8217;s a real lack of flow to this game now. Serhiy Kryvtsov bangs knees with an opponent and is down in a lot of pain, needing treatment. This does look a nasty one, and play stops for quite some time for him to receive treatment. The 32-year-old Ukrainian eventually does continue, but he&#8217;ll be watched. There will be a lot of added time before the break.</p>
<p><strong>31st min:</strong> Now a booking for FC Cincinnati midfielder Obinna Nwobodo who catches Diego Gomez very late and steps on his foot. That is a proper booking.</p>
<p>Sergio Busquets looks as if he wants a red, but the referee isn&#8217;t having any of his protests. The teams pause for hydration, it&#8217;s 95 degrees (!!!) in Cincinnati.</p>
<div class="twitter-tweet twitter-tweet-rendered"></div>
<p><strong>24th min:</strong> The game&#8217;s first yellow card is shown to Jordi Alba after catching Santiago Arias late in possession. It&#8217;s a soft yellow, there was really no injury risk on that tackle. Late, sure, but not at all dangerous. A harsh booking this early in the match.</p>
<div id="adPlaceholder-9"></div>
<p><strong>22nd min: Chance, Inter Miami!</strong> Just after the match restarted following Boupendza&#8217;s nullified goal, Inter Miami have their first true opportunity! Diego Gomez&#8217;s tight-angle blast is saved well by Alec Kann at the near post. Good stop!</p>
<p><strong>21st min: Chance, FC Cincinnati!</strong> Aaron Boupendza has the ball in the net after chipping Drake Callender, but the offside flag rules it out! He&#8217;s played clean through on a ball from deep, but he&#8217;s definitely leaning offside, which replay confirms!</p>
<p><a id="1-0" role="presentation" name="1-0" aria-hidden="true"></a><strong>20th min: GOAL! FC CINCINNATI!</strong> Luciano Acosta opens the scoring by sneaking one past Drake Callender at the near post! That&#8217;s not one Inter Miami will want to watch back, both defenders (Kamal Miller and Tomas Aviles) could have done better, and Callender&#8217;s save attempt was awkward. There may have been a deflection involved.</p>
<p>The <em>other</em> Argentine No. 10 scores! This is the first time since Lionel Messi has joined that Inter Miami did not score the game&#8217;s first goal.</p>
<div class="twitter-tweet twitter-tweet-rendered"></div>
<p><strong>14th min:</strong> Leo Campana has one for the Yakety Sax reel, all in good fun. The through ball for him brings the Inter Miami striker too far wide for a good shot, and all he can do is swing his foot at it before the ball skids over the end line. It&#8230;doesn&#8217;t end well for Campana, as he whiffs and ends up on his backside. They&#8217;ll have a good laugh watching that one at the holiday party.</p>
<p>This game has been stagnant through the opening stages. Inter Miami look as if they are struggling to adapt to the tactical and personnel changes from an attacking standpoint. Neither back line has been tested yet.</p>
<div class="twitter-tweet twitter-tweet-rendered"></div>
<p><strong>11th min:</strong> Keeping with the theme, Lionel Messi tries to play a vertical ball for Jean Mota but the Brazilian goes down under heavy defensive pressure. No whistle comes, and Mota flails around on the ground with the ball stuck under him until he&#8217;s called for the foul.</p>
<div id="adPlaceholder-10"></div>
<p><strong>8th min:</strong> FC Cincinnati are looking to muck this game up early. Aaron Boupendza&#8217;s antics on the turf in the earlier collision with DeAndre Yedlin were&#8230;a lot, and now Luciano Acosta scythes Sergio Busquets in midfield. Now Tomas Aviles is down and has words for the referee as he complains about the back of his foot being stamped on off the ball.</p>
<p>The hosts are not backing down physically, but that approach has backfired for other clubs in matchups against Lionel Messi&#8217;s Inter Miami throughout the Leagues Cup.</p>
<p><strong>4th min:</strong> Inter Miami have possessed through most of the early minutes through the opening three minutes of this match, but FC Cincinnati are not yet troubled, and finally do get a spell on the ball. An attacking build results in a collision in the penalty area, and players for each team are down on the turf in pain. It&#8217;s DeAndre Yedlin and Aaron Boupendza.</p>
<p>U.S. fans are treated to Ray Hudson on the call, which is just the way the universe wants it with Lionel Messi on the field. Hudson partnered with tonight&#8217;s play-by-play Dre Cordero on Inter Miami TV broadcasters during last season&#8217;s MLS campaign.</p>
<p><strong>Kickoff:</strong> This semifinal of the 2023 U.S. Open Cup has begun! The best team in the Eastern Conference, and the worst team in the Eastern Conference meet in Cincinnati. Some other Cincinnati athletes are in attendance to watch their fellow Ohio pro team!</p>
<div class="twitter-tweet twitter-tweet-rendered"></div>
<h3><strong>FC Cincinnati vs Inter Miami</strong>: Pre-match commentary, analysis, stats, and more</h3>
<p><strong>15 mins to kick:</strong> Interestingly, teams are only afforded seven available substitutes on the bench for U.S. Open Cup matches, which is fewer than usual. Teams were afforded 12 players on the bench through the Leagues Cup, while MLS games afford teams nine throughout the season, which are both consistent with European league and Cup competitions.</p>
<p>Despite having only seven bench players available on each team, both clubs are still allowed the usual five substitutions, as well as three sub windows outside of the halftime break. With this, most players made available for this game will likely get on the field.</p>
<p><strong>30 mins to kick:</strong> DeAndre Yedlin joined the CBS Sports pregame show, and made it clear that while the last month was understandably fun, they aren&#8217;t resting on their laurels after making history.</p>
<p><strong>45 mins to kick:</strong> Lineups are in, and after using the same lineup throughout the Leagues Cup, Tata Martino has made a host of changes to the Inter Miami XI. Lionel Messi remains, as do Sergio Busquets and Jordi Alba, but there&#8217;s a formational switch as three center-backs are present.</p>
<p>20-year-old midfielder Diego Gomez and 19-year-old defender Tomas Aviles both start, as does Brazilian midfielder Jean Mota who hasn&#8217;t played in months due to injury.</p>
<p>For FC Cincinnati, goalkeeper Alec Kann comes in as the Cup starter, while Matt Miazga returns from suspension along the back line.</p>
<p><strong>1 hour to kick:</strong> Tonight&#8217;s U.S. broadcast on Paramount+, which will be viewable for free on the CBS Sports Golazo Network, will feature some unique quirks.</p>
<p>According to CBS, the streamed broadcast will feature a &#8220;Star Cam&#8221; option which will only focus on Lionel Messi. Additionally, USMNT star Christian Pulisic will join the network&#8217;s prematch show which begins an hour before kickoff — so, right now.</p>
<p><strong>1 hour 15 mins to kick:</strong> Inter Miami&#8217;s American goalkeeper Drake Callender has been included on Gregg Berhalter&#8217;s provisional roster for the USMNT September friendlies against Uzbekestan and Oman, according to Fox reporter Doug McIntyre.</p>
<p>So too has midfielder Benji Cremaschi, who is just 18 years old and a dual international with Argentina. Cremaschi has blossomed since Lionel Messi&#8217;s arrival at Inter Miami, becoming a regular starter for Tata Martino, and he has yet to commit for a senior national team, having played for both nations at the youth level — he actually trained with each youth team in consecutive months last fall.</p>
<div id="adPlaceholder-12"></div>
<p>Cremaschi would not be cap-tied playing in the September friendlies, but it surely would go a long way to see him in a USA jersey.</p>
<p><strong>1 hour 30 mins to kick:</strong> Much has been made of Lionel Messi&#8217;s flow during a game, and how much he walks. It&#8217;s not an inaccurate thing to say that Messi walks a ton — in fact, there&#8217;s data to back that up. But what&#8217;s amazing is just how unpredictable he is. He&#8217;s not lazy, he&#8217;s simply reading the game to find openings.</p>
<p>Pablo Maurer of The Athletic produced a wonderful article by spending a whole match with his camera trying to photograph Messi. He points out that as a photographer, learning a player&#8217;s movement and tendencies is helpful to predict where they will be and what they will do, to get the best shot. He then concludes that what makes Messi so hard to defend is his unpredictability.</p>
<p>That is all on full display with this excellent video of Messi&#8217;s goal against Nashville SC. He spends significant time walking, before bursting into an attacking move and changing direction at lightning speed. Nobody knows what is coming.</p>
<p><strong>1 hour 45 mins to kick:</strong> Lionel Messi is getting close to a career record. He has scored a goal in eight straight games for club and country, dating back to his goal for Argentina in a 1-0 friendly win over Australia earlier this summer. Tack on at least a goal in all seven Leagues Cup games, and Messi stands close to his all-time record of 10, which he&#8217;s done twice.</p>
<p>Can he extend that streak tonight and put himself in a position to tie his personal best on the weekend, when he makes his MLS debut?</p>
<p><strong>2 hours to kickoff:</strong> Welcome to the Sporting News&#8217; live coverage of the U.S. Open Cup semifinals. Lionel Messi&#8217;s start to his Inter Miami career has been sensational, with 10 goals in his first seven games. But his off-field presence has been equally as spectacular, proving not only one of the world&#8217;s best players but also the world&#8217;s best captains.</p>
<div id="adPlaceholder-13"></div>
<p>The Sporting News has compiled some of the best moments of Messi&#8217;s first month in the United States off the field as the Argentine proves just as capable a leader as he is a goalscorer:</p>
<h2><strong>FC Cincinnati vs Inter Miami</strong> lineups &amp; team news</h2>
<p>An injury to mainstay center-back <strong>Yerson Mosquera</strong> is a blow to the Cincinnati defense, which was laid bare in their weekend defeat at Columbus Crew. USMNT defender <strong>Matt Miazga</strong> was also missing from the weekend&#8217;s match, suspended for yellow card accumulation, but he returns.</p>
<p>Otherwise, the FC Cincinnati lineup has remained largely unchanged, with both sides have a short turnaround for this game. There is one swap, as <strong>Alec Kann</strong> comes into goal as he has spelled <strong>Roman Celentano</strong> throughout the U.S. Open Cup.</p>
<p>USMNT striker <strong>Brandon Vazquez</strong> scored five goals in three Leagues Cup matches, and has two goals in his two U.S. Open Cup starts, but was held off the scoresheet over the weekend by the Crew.</p>
<p><strong>FC Cincinnati starting lineup (3-4-1-2):</strong> Kann (GK) — Hagglund, Miazga, I. Murphy — Arias, Moreno, Nwobodo, Barreal — L. Acosta — Boupendza, Vazquez.</p>
<p><strong>FC Cincinnati subs (7): </strong>Celentano (GK), Angulo, S. Santos, Gaddis, Halsey, Powell, Kubo.</p>
<p>One of the biggest tests for head coach Gerardo Martino in the coming weeks will be to figure out how to find rest for aging stars <strong>Lionel Messi</strong>, <strong>Sergio Busquets</strong> and <strong>Jordi Alba</strong> despite the massive importance of every game from here on out.</p>
<p>&#8220;Tata&#8221; has decided to rest some other players for this match, however, amidst a host of changes. <strong>Robert Taylor</strong> and <strong>Benji Cremaschi</strong> are sat following a grueling Leagues Cup journey. 20-year-old midfielder <strong>Diego Gomez</strong> and 19-year-old defender <strong>Tomas Aviles</strong> both start, as does Brazilian midfielder <strong>Jean Mota</strong> who hasn&#8217;t played in months due to injury.</p>
<p>Also benched is struggling striker <strong>Josef Martinez</strong>, as <strong>Leo Campana</strong> enters the attack in his place. Martino has gone with three center-backs, meaning <strong>Jordi Alba</strong> and <strong>DeAndre Yedlin</strong> will play a more attacking wing-back role.</p>
<p><strong>Inter Miami starting lineup (3-5-2):</strong> Callender (GK) — Kryvtsov, Aviles, Miller — Yedlin, D. Gomez, Busquets, Mota, Alba — Messi, Campana.</p>
<p><strong>Inter Miami subs (7):</strong> Dos Santos (GK), Farias, Allen, D. Ruiz, Cremaschi, R. Taylor, J. Martinez.</p>

<h2><strong>FC Cincinnati vs Inter Miami</strong> betting odds &amp; lines</h2>
<p>Inter Miami are favorites for this match, understandably so as no team has yet managed to best them with Lionel Messi, Sergio Busquets and Jordi Alba on the side. Yet FC Cincinnati are clearly given a chance to succeed and advance to the final, with Inter Miami only sporting plus three-way moneyline odds.</p>
<p>While the winner seems to be in question, there&#8217;s no debating that the betting market expects goals. The total has been inflated to 3.5, and both teams are widely expected to find the back of the net.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Fans trying to purchase tickets to six of the pop superstar’s concerts faced long queues and technical issues before the company said that a new on-sale time would be announced. Ticketmaster has once again cracked under the weight of a Taylor Swift ticket sale — this time in France.</p>
<p>As French fans prepared on Tuesday to purchase tickets to six concerts in May and June 2024 on Swift’s Eras Tour — four shows in Paris, two in Lyon — Ticketmaster’s website displayed a gigantic queue of customers ready to buy; one screenshot appeared to tell a fan that 1,023,504 shoppers were in line ahead of them.</p>
<p>Soon, Ticketmaster announced that sales for those shows had been placed on “pause.” The company said that a new on-sale time would be announced, and that “all codes not already used will remain valid.” But some fans’ social media posts seemed to show technical errors on Ticketmaster’s website, including a progress icon that “keeps spinning and spinning and spinning,” as one fan — speaking English with an American accent, but with 762 euros’ worth of tickets in their shopping cart — put it.</p>
<p>A few hours later, the French branch of Ticketmaster offered some more detail on social media, blaming the problem on a “third-party provider” that the company did not identify, and adding that tickets were still available. A representative of Live Nation Entertainment, Ticketmaster’s corporate parent, said that the provider works with Ticketmaster only in France.</p>
<p>The situation in France appeared to be a frustrating repeat of the problems that plagued Swift’s North American presale in November, when an influx of millions of fans — and bots — overwhelmed Ticketmaster’s systems, and fans reported issues like tickets in their shopping carts disappearing before they could be purchased. Ticketmaster shut down its public sale as a result, though the company also said it had sold more than two million tickets to the tour in a single day.</p>
<p>Problems like those at Swift’s presale in November — as well as long-simmering concerns over Ticketmaster and Live Nation’s market dominance — led to a brutal Senate Judiciary hearing in January. Senators from both parties flatly called the company a monopoly and were skeptical of an executive’s explanation that Ticketmaster was unable to defend itself against an onslaught of bots during Swift’s presale.</p>
<p>“This is unbelievable,” Senator Marsha Blackburn, Republican of Tennessee, said at the hearing. “Why is it,” she added, “that you have not developed an algorithm to sort out what is a bot and what is a consumer?”</p>
<p>Yet the demand for Swift tickets has been extraordinary, with Swift selling out stadiums everywhere she plays and tickets going for thousands of dollars on the secondary market. She is scheduled to complete the North American leg of her tour next month, then play in Latin America, Asia and Europe.</p>
<p>The Justice Department has separately been conducting an antitrust investigation of Live Nation. The Justice Department has not confirmed that investigation, but Live Nation’s chief executive, Michael Rapino, has spoken about it openly.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Nobody is quite sure where the term “kayfabe” originated. It may be a bastardized form of pig Latin, something to do with the actual word “fake.” It may have its roots in the culture of wandering 19th-century carnivals, the world inhabited by P.T. Barnum and the confidence men and the salesmen who sold actual snake oil.</p>
<p>Its modern usage, though, is sufficiently specific that only a relatively small proportion of people would even have a sense of what it means. Kayfabe is, essentially, the illusory cloak that is doggedly draped over professional wrestling: the maintenance of the pretense that what you see in the ring is unscripted, competitive, what we would consider real.</p>
<p>For decades, wrestlers were expected to keep kayfabe even when they were off the clock. The on-screen heroes and villains were not supposed to drive to events together, or to socialize together after them, in case they were seen and the illusion was broken. The omertà had to be upheld at all costs. Breaching it was not just a transgression. It was a betrayal.</p>
<p>As Abraham Josephine Riesman delineates in “Ringmaster,” her magisterial biography of Vince McMahon — close personal friend of Donald Trump and longstanding, all-purpose tyrant behind World Wrestling Entertainment — there came a point, sometime around the 1990s, when that all felt just a little anachronistic.</p>
<p>For anyone other than perhaps the very young, she posits, by that stage most wrestling fans had long understood the nature of what they were watching. More than that, they had delighted in it. Riesman’s theory is that the fun was not so much in seeing who won, but in trying to decode the why. What did this star’s propulsion mean for behind-the-scenes politics? What did this defeat indicate about the next twist in the never-ending tale?</p>
<p>McMahon’s genius — again, in Riesman’s telling — was that he accepted the new reality. Rather than try to cling on to the tradition, to insist on the fantasy, he leaned into the wink and the nudge.</p>
<p>Nobody ever said, of course, that the whole thing was a soap opera, a piece of brutal theater. But the sense that the real story could be found in what was happening backstage, that there was a political process behind who rose and who fell — all of that moved front and center. McMahon invented what Riesman calls neokayfabe.</p>
<p>In the late 1980s and early 1990s, as McMahon was pioneering this new approach, soccer was changing, too. Delegations of executives from Europe’s major teams looked on jealously at the sporting landscape of the United States, where money flowed freely from television, through glamorous, lucrative leagues, and straight into their counterparts’ pockets.</p>
<p>It was the N.F.L., with its cheerleaders and its fireworks and its sense of event, that caught their eyes particularly, and they returned home with whatever ideas they could mimic. Dance troupes appeared at midtable Premier League games. Flashy graphics and portentous music splashed across television screens. Stadiums modernized, attracting more families. That allowed ticket prices to increase and corporate sections to flourish.</p>

<p><i>By Paloma Toranzos, Head of the Environment and Sustainable Development Programme and Fernando Córdova, Public Climate Expenditure Project Manager, <a href="https://edu.ndcs.undp.org/">PNUD</a> Chile</i></p>
<p>Across Chile’s mountains, valleys and coasts, the fingerprints of climate change are becoming more and more evident. Rainfall is becoming more unpredictable. Extreme weather is on the rise.</p>
<p>According to the Centre for Research on the Epidemiology of Disasters (EM-DAT), the country recorded 38 episodes of floods or catastrophic landslides, 12 severe storms, 13 wildfires, and nine episodes of extreme heat between 1970 and 2019 &#8212; around two million people were affected, with damages estimated at US$4.785 million.</p>
<p>Such extreme climate events have become 30 times more frequent over the past fifty years.</p>
<p>It’s also getting hotter and drier. The last decade has been the warmest in the last 100 years. Rainfall has been scarce in recent years – in 2020, the central zone of the country (from Coquimbo to Bío Bío) experienced an average precipitation deficit of 38 percent.</p>
<p>Combined, the rainfall shortages and extreme heat have led to an unprecedented ‘mega-drought’ – with direct consequences for agricultural livelihoods and food security, and the health and overall quality of life of rural communities.</p>
</div>
<div class="image parbase section">
<figure><figcaption>In the context of severe ongoing drought, the Chilean Government’s efforts to secure water for vulnerable rural communities have been essential. Playing a key role are the Division of Hydraulic Works under the Ministry of Public Works and the National Irrigation Commission under the Ministry of Agriculture. Together they implement initiatives focused on the building, expansion, and improvement of rural drinking water systems that supply isolated communities disconnected from infrastructure.

</div>
<div class="parbase section text">
<h2>Data for decision-making</h2>
<p>At the forefront of the government’s response to climate change, the Ministry for Finance and the Budget Office (Dirección de Presupuestos, or DIPRES) are leading several key initiatives. These include an effort to better understand public spending on climate change-related programmes and investments (adaptation and mitigation), including those related to water access.</p>
<p>Under the NDC Support Programme, UNDP has been supporting the Ministry and DIPRES to advance its climate agenda, drawing on the methodologies Climate Public Expenditure and Institutional Review (CPEIR) and Climate Budget Tagging (CBT).</p>
<p>The results so far include the identification of adaptation and mitigation initiatives across different ministries, including the Ministries for Public Works, Agriculture and Energy.</p>
<p>For example, according to data available from the National System of Investment (Sistema Nacional de Inversiones, or SNI), 170 rural drinking water projects were developed between 2016 and 2020 across the Coquimbo, Valparaíso, O’Higgins and the Metropolitan regions (regions that face severe water scarcity and were recently declared to be under an agricultural emergency). More than 134 billion Chilean pesos (approximately US$6.5 billion), averaging around 27 billion pesos per year, have been channelled by the Ministry of Public Works and Regional Governments towards these projects.</p>
<p>In another example, data gathered under the Bank of Social Programmes and Non-Social Programmes of the Ministry of Social Development and Family and DIPRES has revealed that of 32 programmes identified as associated with climate change, five addressed the impacts of water shortages.</p>
<p>The data highlights significant government efforts already underway to address the impacts of climate change, with direct benefits for communities. However, and most importantly, the data also helps to identify the gaps, investment priorities, and policies which will allow Chile to continue to address climate change impacts in the years ahead. DIPRES has now committed to report the results annually to the Parliament.</p>
<p>&#8220;By classifying public spending and its contribution to climate change, it is possible to evaluate the effect of policies and activities carried out at the national level, in addition to determining the efficiency and effectiveness of budget spending”, says Cristobal Gamboni, Macroeconomic and International Finance Coordinator at the Ministry of Finance.</p>
<p>&#8220;This classification helps generate indicators for the management of climate spending, quantifying the fiscal cost of both mitigation and adaptation measures in the long-term, making their impact visible and deciding with more information – which also enables the alignment of environmental objectives, national objectives and international commitments.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is why the Ministry of Finance of Chile considers it essential to have this kind of classification for public spending, giving priority to this work.&#8221;</p>

<div class="parbase section text">
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Looking ahead</h2>
<p>With its diverse geography and a susceptibility to natural disasters, Chile is acutely vulnerable to climate change.</p>
<p>The Chilean Government is focused on reducing this vulnerability by implementing a national Action Plan for Climate Change (2017-2022) and an enhanced Nationally Determined Contribution, while also closely examining the finance required.</p>
<p>UNDP will now support the government in expanding the measurement of climate-related expenditures to other public institutions included in the Budget Law. The Private Sector Climate Expenditure and Institutional Review (PCEIR) may also inform the measurement of private investment.</p>
<p>As the country seeks to promote low-carbon, sustainable and inclusive development, it is key to have a better comprehension of how money is being spent and how efficiently.</p>

<p class="intro">This year’s Cranleigh Schools’ Photography Exhibition asked students to take photographs on the theme of ‘Culture’.</p>
<p><i>Ex Robur Cultur</i>, From Culture comes Strength,  the Cranleigh motto, was the inspiration and our young people, across all five Cranleigh Schools, have answered with some exciting images.</p>
<p>On show is a selection of 37 photographs taken from a total entry of 154. The photographs ask us to think about what culture is. Is it a playful cat? Can nature, as seen in a beautiful sunset, represent our culture? Or is it in how we relate to one another, the friendships we make, the activities we see around us, the man made spaces that we move through, the objects we consume, or the games we play?</p>
<p>Enjoy these entries via the gallery below and see what best answers the question: “What is culture?” for yourself. The exhibition is also on show , in physical form, in the Woodyer Art Studios until early next term, including this year’s Speech Day.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Flt Sgt Peter Brown, born on 22nd August 1926 – 17th December 2022, was a RAF volunteer pilot who served in a group of Afro-Caribbean volunteer RAF personnel now affectionately known as the “Pilots of the Caribbean”. Peter was enlisted in 1943, trained in Jamaica and Canada, worked as a wireless operator, and flew on Lancaster Bombers towards the end of the war. Despite restrictions of segregation and colonialism placed upon black people at the time, he and the rest of the pilots he flew with constantly proved others’ biases and judgements wrong. As Peter had moved to the UK to represent the colonies in the war at such a young age he had very few family members attending the funeral, so the RAF put a call out for people if they wished to come and pay their respects, and flew some of his family over from Jamaica. So many people wished to attend that they moved the funeral from its originally planned time and location, Mortlake Crematorium in south-west London in March, to the central RAF church, St Clement Danes in May. It was empowering to see so many uniting together to commemorate his life.</p>
<p>The event itself was a sombre one, held on a fairly sunny day where hundreds of mourners gathered outside of the St Clements Dane Church along the Strand. Soon after arriving we were welcomed inside and provided with the opportunity to meet another group of Cadets who were currently in the ATC (Air Training Corps). We found this an interesting opportunity because it gave us insight into how other Cadets groups were run, specifically those which were not tied to schools, and this gave us a deeper appreciation for the hard work that many put in to make Cadets possible.</p>
<p>Once the funeral began, we all were greatly appreciative of the quality of service that was delivered by the Chaplaincy. Powerful hymns and readings echoed throughout the magnificent Church building, but one thing that particularly stood out to us was the Tribute given by a neighbour, Melvyn Caplan, highlighting his and many others’ admiration of Flt Sgt Brown regarding his modesty about his achievements during the war and how he just wanted to get on with his life as normal. This held immense worth because the magnitude of Flt Sgt Brown’s legacy is not to be underestimated. This is because he was in fact the last living Afro-Caribbean pilot of WWII, which meant that the funeral became something that stood for much more than Flt Sgt Peter Brown.</p>
<p>Another significant moment in the service was when the singer and British veteran Maurillia Simpson told the congregation about how she was injured in service and had recently had surgery on her spine after being paralysed. It was a truly amazing moment when she stood up and sang two incredibly symbolic songs for Flt Sgt Brown, the ultimate show of respect and gratitude for his life’s work.</p>
<p>Once the funeral came to a close, we were invited outside for further conversation with the other attendees. We found this to be one of the most impactful parts of the day as it was touching to hear many of them speaking of how this was one of the first military organised events that had been mainly attended by an non-white British majority. We found reflecting on this event highly thought-provoking and although we were not able to empathise with the opportunity they had been given, we gained a deep respect for the privilege often being the majority in similar events.</p>
<p>Overall, we found that the funeral was a day of great importance to many, not only because we were able to remember and celebrate the life of Flt Sgt Peter Brown, but also because we were able to witness a much deeper message be conveyed by many that highlighted the importance and underappreciation of Caribbean people’s invaluable contributions to military service and the war effort during WWII and subsequent service and contribution to Britain afterwards.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hangovers seem to be the body&#8217;s way of reminding us about the hazards of overindulgence. Physiologically, it&#8217;s a group effort: Diarrhea, fatigue, headache, nausea, and shaking are the classic symptoms. Sometimes, systolic (the upper number) blood pressure goes up, the heart beats faster than normal, and sweat glands overproduce — evidence that the &#8220;fight or flight&#8221; response is revved up. Some people become sensitive to light or sound. Others suffer a spinning sensation (vertigo).</p>
<p>The result is pure misery. Fortunately, knowing the causes of hangovers, as well as different ways to cure a hangover, can help.</p>
<h2>What causes hangovers?</h2>
<p>The causes are as varied as the symptoms. Alcohol is metabolized into acetaldehyde, a substance that&#8217;s toxic at high levels. However, concentrations rarely get that high, so that&#8217;s not the complete explanation.</p>
<p>Drinking interferes with brain activity during sleep, so a hangover may be a form of sleep deprivation. Alcohol scrambles the hormones that regulate our biological clocks, which may be why a hangover can feel like jet lag, and vice versa. Alcohol can also trigger migraines, so some people may think they&#8217;re hung over when it&#8217;s really an alcohol-induced migraine they&#8217;re suffering.</p>
<p>Hangovers begin after blood alcohol levels start to fall. In fact, according to some experts, the worst symptoms occur when levels reach zero.</p>
<p>The key ingredient seems to be &#8220;drinking to intoxication&#8221;; how much you drank to get there is less important. In fact, several studies suggest that light and moderate drinkers are more vulnerable to getting a hangover than heavy drinkers. Yet there&#8217;s also seemingly contradictory research showing that people with a family history of alcoholism have worse hangovers. Researchers say some people may end up with drinking problems because they drink in an effort to relieve hangover symptoms.</p>

<div class="sm:grid sm:grid-cols-3 sm:gap-8">
<div class="sm:col-span-2">
<h2>7 hangover remedies</h2>
<p>Obviously, not drinking any alcohol is the best solution. But if you do drink, here are simple tips to help prevent and relieve the misery.</p>
<p><strong>1. Drinking fluids<em>.</em></strong> Alcohol promotes urination because it inhibits the release of vasopressin, a hormone that decreases the volume of urine made by the kidneys. If your hangover includes diarrhea, sweating, or vomiting, you may be even more dehydrated. Although nausea can make it difficult to get anything down, even just a few sips of water might help your hangover.</p>
<p><strong>2. Getting some carbohydrates into your system<em>.</em></strong> Drinking may lower blood sugar levels, so theoretically some of the fatigue and headaches of a hangover may be from a brain working without enough of its main fuel. Moreover, many people forget to eat when they drink, further lowering their blood sugar. Toast and juice is a way to gently nudge levels back to normal.</p>
<p><strong>3. Avoiding darker-colored alcoholic beverages<em>.</em></strong> Experiments have shown that clear liquors, such as vodka and gin, tend to cause hangovers less frequently than dark ones, such as whiskey, red wine, and tequila. The main form of alcohol in alcoholic beverages is ethanol, but the darker liquors contain chemically related compounds (congeners), including methanol. The same enzymes process ethanol and methanol, but methanol metabolites are especially toxic, so they may cause a worse hangover.</p>
<p><strong>4. Taking a pain reliever — but not Tylenol<em>.</em></strong> Aspirin, ibuprofen (Motrin, other brands), and other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) may help with the headache and the overall achy feelings. NSAIDs, though, may irritate a stomach already irritated by alcohol. Don&#8217;t take acetaminophen (Tylenol): if alcohol is lingering in your system, it may accentuate acetaminophen&#8217;s toxic effects on the liver.</p>
<p><strong>5. Drinking coffee or tea<em>.</em></strong> Caffeine may not have any special anti-hangover powers, but as a stimulant, it could help with the grogginess. However, it&#8217;s important to keep in mind that caffeine and alcohol should never be mixed because the caffeine can mask the depressant effects of alcohol, making drinkers feel more alert than they would otherwise.</p>
<p><strong>6. Taking B vitamins and zinc<em>.</em></strong> A study published in <em>The Journal of Clinical Medicine</em> evaluated the diets for 24 hours before and after excessive drinking occurred. It was a small study and results were based on the participants saying what they ate. However, they did find that people whose food and beverage consumption contained greater amounts of zinc and B vitamins had less severe hangovers.</p>
<p><strong>7. Hair of the dog. </strong>Drinking to ease the symptoms of a hangover is sometimes called taking the hair of the dog, or hair of the dog that bit you. The notion is that hangovers are a form of alcohol withdrawal, so a drink or two will ease the withdrawal. However, the hair of the dog just perpetuates a cycle. It doesn&#8217;t allow you to recover.</p>
<h2>How to prevent hangovers</h2>
<p>Hangovers affects individuals differently. For example, the effects of alcohol on a smaller person will usually be greater than on a larger person. These tips may help you prevent having a hangover when drinking alcohol:</p>
<ul>
<li>Drink slowly and on a full stomach.</li>
<li>Drink in moderation.</li>
<li>Women should have no more than 1 drink per day and men no more than 2 drinks per day. One drink is defined as 12 fluid ounces (360 milliliters) of beer that has about 5% alcohol, 5 fluid ounces (150 milliliters) of wine that has about 12% alcohol, or 1 1/2 fluid ounces (45 milliliters) of 80-proof liquor.</li>
<li>Drink a glass of water in between drinks containing alcohol. This will help you drink less alcohol and decrease dehydration from drinking alcohol.</li>
</ul>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A very funny thing happens to me when I drink coffee. If I don&#8217;t drink one cup when I wake up, I&#8217;m a zombie like most people I know. But if I have more than two (and sometimes just one and a half) I feel wired, giddy, silly, and hyperactive.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a lot like being drunk, right down to the crash once it wears off and the feelings of shame and embarrassment at my coffee-fuelled antics.</p>
<p>I thought maybe I was just ultra-sensitive to the effects of coffee. Nothing too crazy about that. I mean, coffee didn&#8217;t make my breasts smaller, but I&#8217;m definitely sensitive to it. I know a few other people who are also sensitive to the effects of their morning coffee.</p>
<p>But, as it turns out, drinking too much coffee may give the same effects as being drunk.</p>

<h2>Can coffee make you drunk?</h2>
<p>In short, yes.</p>
<p>Most medical professionals will tell you to limit your caffeine intake to 400mg a day. That translates into four cups of coffee in a 24-hour period. (I&#8217;m a java hound and even I acknowledge that it would be hard for me to ingest more than four cups in a day.)</p>

<p>But when someone mentioned a thing called caffeine intoxication, it all started to make sense to me. It would take eight cups of coffee to give the average person that &#8220;drunk&#8221; feeling.</p>
<p><strong>Caffeine intoxication (a very real psychiatric disorder) doesn&#8217;t usually take effect until a person has ingested 1000mg of caffeine, and usually in one sitting.</strong></p>
<p>So what&#8217;s going on with me and my coffee-sensitive friends every time we have a cup of coffee and feel like we&#8217;ve been out partying at the bar all night long?</p>
<h2>Why do some people feel &#8216;drunk&#8217; when they drink too much coffee?</h2>
<h3>Your genetics</h3>
<p>It turns out, it might be that I was just born this way — and that could be the case for you, too.</p>

<p>A 2018 study examined the DNA of 3,000 devoted coffee drinkers. They discovered that (in addition to being real jerks in the morning) some people in the study had a variation of a gene called PDSS2.</p>
<p>Now, that might sound like a fancy kind of video gaming console, but it&#8217;s not. PDSS2 reduces the body&#8217;s ability to break down caffeine.</p>
<p><strong>That means the caffeine that&#8217;s already in your system is going to still be there when you have your second cup of coffee, your third, and your fourth.</strong></p>
<p>So while everyone else is processing their caffeine like a normal adult, you&#8217;re most likely racing around the room, because your DNA is holding on to every sip of caffeine you take and holding on to it for some higher, unforeseeable purpose.</p>
<h3>Your taste buds</h3>
<p>Another potential thing that could be sending you into a drunken-feeling tailspin? Some scientists believe that our taste buds are to blame.</p>
<p>Because bitter tastes were originally perceived to be threatening to early humans, the reaction of giddiness or dizziness to overly bitter tastes like coffee could be a holdover from long ago, when your taste buds could have been sending messages to your body that danger was near.</p>
